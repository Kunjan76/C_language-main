There are two types of accessing a function.
    1. Call by value: 
 Only the values of arguments are same to the function and any change made to the
                formal arguments do not change the actual arguments.

    2. Call by reference: 
                When we pass address to a function the parameters receiving the address should
be pointer. The process of calling a function by using pointer to pass the address of the variable is
known as call by reference.
